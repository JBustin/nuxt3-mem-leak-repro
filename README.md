# Reproduction

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JBustin/nuxt3-mem-leak-repro.git
npm ci
npm run inspect
```

Open the Chrome inspector, at this address: `chrome://inspect/#devices`.

Run the load test in a new terminal (~600 requests during 30s):
```sh
NUXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=MYKEYVALUE npm run load-test
```

Make a head snapshot.

Search for `MYKEYVALUE` in the generated head snapshot.

You should see the same number of records in memory that the number of requests generated by the load tests (~600).
